Data Source: Manually Generated

The data used in this project was manually created for demonstration and testing purposes. No external datasets were used.

User accounts were inserted using SQL scripts to simulate registered users. Recipes, ingredients, and saved recipes were also created by hand through a combination of SQL INSERT statements and frontend form submissions. 

This approach ensured that the database contained valid and varied sample data across all key entities: users, recipes, ingredients, saved recipes, and comments.

The insertions are provided in the `data.sql` file.
